# Time-Series-Analysis

Here I worked on the basics of manipulating time series data. Time series data are data that are
indexed by a sequence of dates or times. I used Pandas to work with this index. Iâ€™ve also worked on
how to resample time series to change the frequency. I have also shown how to calculate rolling
and cumulative values for times series. Finally, I built a value-weighted stock index from
actual stock data.
